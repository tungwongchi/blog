# Multi role-playing large language model

Posted on 2024-03-16 by Tungwong Chi

## Abstract

Role-playing in conversational AI allows for the simulation of various characters and scenarios, providing rich and diverse interactions. We propose mRP-LLM, a novel approach that integrates multiple role-playing characters into a single model to maximize resource efficiency and expand the model's conversational capabilities.

## 1. Introduction

Role-playing within AI-driven conversational systems offers immersive experiences in various domains. Traditional models require separate instances for each character, leading to high computational costs. We introduce mRP-LLM, a unified model architecture capable of simulating multiple roles, conserving resources, and enabling complex interactions.
